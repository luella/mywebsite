			<legend>About Me</legend>

			<p>
				I have loved statistics since taking A.P. Statistics in <a href="http://gunn.pausd.org/"> high school</a> with Ms. Clark<sup>1</sup>. The idea that statistics could quantify evidence in order to resolve questions was tremendously exciting. Then in <a href="https://www.cmc.edu/"> college</a>, I was further encouraged by <a href="https://www.cmc.edu/academic/faculty/profile/yaron-raviv"> Dr. Raviv</a>, who fully supported my desire to study more. My <a href="http://statistics.yale.edu"> master's experience</a> gave me a new way to appreciate statistics when I learned how much deep mathematical analysis undergirds statistics, and the summer internship at Facebook that followed made me want to understand the theoretical principles behind the methods I was using. Then I completed my <a href="https://www.marshall.usc.edu/departments/data-sciences-and-operations">PhD at USC</a>, where I was introduced to  large-scale statistical inference. <!--I plan to deepen my understanding of this field at SFSU through research, teaching, and discussions with industry professionals. -->
			</p>

			<p>  My graduate school experience was illuminated by faculty, collaborators, and peers. My co-advisors were <a href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~wenguans/">Dr. Wenguang Sun</a> and <a href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/">Dr. Gareth James</a>. Their quality of thought, creativity, and work flow inspire me all the time. Other collaborators with whom I have worked closely have included <a href="https://www.isb.edu/faculty-research/faculty/directory/basu-pallavi">Dr. Pallavi Basu</a> on multiple testing; my sister Dr. Sue
				Fu on a study of surgical costs; and <a href="http://keck.usc.edu/faculty/thomas-william-valente/"> Dr. Thomas Valente</a>, Megan Jacobs, Jody Brookover, Dr. Nate Cobb, and Dr. Amanda
				Graham on social network and health research. When conducting research on model selection, I was also advised by Dr. Yingying Fan and Dr. Jinchi Lv.
			</p>

			<p>
				My community made a hugely positive impact on my life and research. <a href="https://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/directory/courtney-paulson">Dr. Courtney Paulson</a> and <a href="https://www.isb.edu/faculty-research/faculty/directory/basu-pallavi">Dr. Pallavi Basu</a> were a joy with whom to share part of the PhD experience, while <a href="http://personal.lse.ac.uk/qiaox/">Dr. Xinghao Qiao </a> fearlessly
				led the way for us all! PhD students <a href = "https://www.marshall.usc.edu/personnel/weinan-wang"> Weinan Wang</a>, <a href = "https://trambakbanerjee.github.io/"> Trambak Banerjee</a>, and <a href = "https://www.marshall.usc.edu/personnel/joshua-derenski"> Josh Derenski</a> were great company and  made me very proud of our PhD program. I was also fortunate that my time overlapped with PhD students <a href="https://bradleyrava.github.io"> Brad Rava</a>, <a href="https://www.marshall.usc.edu/personnel/simeng-shao">Simone Shao</a>, <a href="https://www.marshall.usc.edu/personnel/wilson-lin">Wilson Lin</a>,  <a href="https://www.marshall.usc.edu/personnel/michael-huang">Michael Huang</a>, and <a href="https://www.marshall.usc.edu/personnel/patrick-vossler"> Patrick Vossler</a>, who greatly added to my community. I am deeply grateful to everyone mentioned and also to the former PhD chair <a href="https://www.marshall.usc.edu/faculty/directory/sosic">Dr. Greys Sosic</a>, who
				worked very patiently and with great sensitivity with us students. Also, decades of thanks go to my friend <a href="http://dushanperera.com"> Dushan Perera</a>, who took my website design from the '90s into the 21st century.

			<p> Two other things I like are technology and running. Having grown up in Silicon Valley, I believe (rather fervidly) that technology will change the world for the better. The digitization of health data, the services embedded in many crytpocurrencies, and artificial intelligence are particularly interesting.
			I once ran 20 miles for an <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/diddy-riese-los-angeles">icecream sandwich</a>. It was worth it. I also once ran 31 miles around San Francisco. On the way out, I ran the coast line from Ocean Beach to the Embarcadero. On the way back, I ran by the Presidio and through Golden Gate Park. It was probably the most beautiful run I've ever taken. </p>

			<p> I also have a sister, Dr. Sue Fu, who completed her medical degree at Case Western and is a general surgery resident at Stanford. I am so proud of her. </p>

			<p class = "footnote"><sup>1</sup> During my PhD, I found another Gunn student who was inspired to pursue a PhD because of Ms. Clark's class!
