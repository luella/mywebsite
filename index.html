			<legend>Overview</legend>
			<p> I am Luella Fu, a Ph.D. candidate in the <a class="bold" href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/StatGroup/"> statistics group</a>,
				part of the  Department of Data Sciences and Operations at University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business. My methodological focuses are in nonparametric <a 
				 href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_Bayes_method"> empirical Bayes methods</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_comparisons_problem">multiple testing</a>. This is an amazing field with so many applications to large-scale data and so much still to develop in terms of theoretically-backed statistical techniques.
				I previously worked on
				<a class="bold" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_(mathematics)#Regularization_in_statistics_and_machine_learning">high dimensional regression and model selection</a>.
				I am also interested in how statistics are used in application, and have worked on medical and social network problems.
			</p>

			<p> Teaching is also a primary interest of mine. I have instructed one class, guest-lectured a few, and been teaching or course
				assistant for several. My CV is <a href="cv/LuellaFu_CV.pdf"> here. </a> I want to try <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom">flipping the classroom </a> so that in class, students can test their learning by trying out problems, have more resources to troubleshoot their difficulties, do activities together, and exchange thoughts. At home, they can watch lecture segments at their own pace. Having attended teaching workshops at USC's <a href="http://cet.usc.edu/"> Center for Excellence in Teaching </a>, I have been cautioned that this can be a very ambitious endeavor. Therefore, my first goal is to flip a single lesson.
			</p>

			<p> My graduate school experience has been illuminated by faculty, collaborators, and peers. My co-advisors are <a href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~wenguans/">Dr. Wenguang Sun</a> and <a href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/">Dr. Gareth James</a>. Their quality of thought, creativity, and work flow inspire me all the time.

			<p>
				Other collaborators with whom I have worked closely have included Dr. Pallavi Basu on multiple testing; my sister Dr. Sue
				Fu on a study of surgical costs; and <a href="http://keck.usc.edu/faculty/thomas-william-valente/"> Dr. Thomas Valente</a>, Megan Jacobs, Jody Brookover, Dr. Nate Cobb, and Dr. Amanda
				Graham on social network and health research. When conducting research on model selection, I was also advised by Dr.
				Yingying Fan and Dr. Jinchi Lv.
			</p>

			<p>
				My community made a hugely positive impact on my life and research. <a href="https://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/directory/courtney-paulson">Dr. Courtney Paulson</a> and Dr. Pallavi Basu were a
				joy with whom to share part of the PhD experience, while <a href="http://personal.lse.ac.uk/qiaox/">Dr. Xinghao Qiao </a> fearlessly
				led the way for us all! PhD students <a href = "https://www.marshall.usc.edu/personnel/weinan-wang"> Weinan Wang</a>, <a href = "https://www.marshall.usc.edu/personnel/trambak-banerjee"> Trambak Banerjee </a>, and <a href = "https://www.marshall.usc.edu/personnel/joshua-derenski"> Josh Derenski </a> have also been great company and  made me very proud of our PhD program. I am deeply grateful to everyone mentioned and also to PhD chair <a href="https://www.marshall.usc.edu/faculty/directory/sosic">Greys Sosic</a>,
				who has worked very patiently and with great sensitivity with us students. Also, decades of thanks go to my best friend <a href="http://dushanperera.com"> Dushan Perera, </a> who took my website design from the '90s into the 21st century.
