			<p> I am Luella Fu, a Ph.D. candidate in the <a href = "http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/StatGroup/"> statistics group</a>, part of the <a href = "https://www.marshall.usc.edu/faculty/iom/about"> Department of Data Sciences and Operations </a> at University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business. My methodological focuses have been in <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_comparisons_problem">multiple testing</a> and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_(mathematics)#Regularization_in_statistics_and_machine_learning">high dimensional regression</a>. I am also interested in how statistics are used in application, and have worked on medical and social network problems. 
			 </p>

			 <p> My graduate school experience has been illuminated by faculty, collaborators, and peers. My advisor is <a href = "http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~wenguans/">Dr. Wenguang Sun</a>. We are studying statistical methods for large-scale estimation and inference jointly with  <a href = "http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/">Dr. Gareth James</a>.  

			 When conducting research on model selection, I also worked under Dr. Yingying Fan and Dr. Jinchi Lv. Other collaborators have included Dr. Pallavi Basu on multiple testing; my dear sister Dr. Sue Fu on a study of surgical costs; and Dr. Thomas Valente, Megan Jacobs, Jody Brookover, Dr. Nate Cobb, and Dr. Amanda Graham on social network and health research. My graduate school experience has been particularly wonderful thanks to <a href = "https://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/directory/courtney-paulson">Dr. Courtney Paulson</a> and Dr. Pallavi Basu. Also, I am deeply grateful to PhD chair <a href = "https://www.marshall.usc.edu/faculty/directory/sosic">Greys Sosic</a>, who has worked very patiently and with great sensitivity with us students. For everyone's perspectives and conversations, I am so thankful. </p>
